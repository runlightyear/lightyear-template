/**
 * This is where we defined the task management collection.
 *
 * A collection serves as a canonical representation of data that needs to be synchronized across multiple
 * applications.
 *
 * At its core, a collection defines one or more modelsâ€”essentially, the structures that represent
 * the various types of information within the collection. These models can include schemas that enforce data
 * integrity every time new information is written, ensuring consistency and accuracy throughout the system.
 *
 * Additionally, collections support the use of matching rules. These rules are instrumental in merging data
 * from different systems when appropriate. For example, when a contact appears in several systems, an email
 * address can be used as a matching criterion to unify and deduplicate records.
